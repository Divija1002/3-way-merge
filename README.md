This repository is a collection of Git exercises. The concept is stolen without shame from Schauderhaft.de. Unfortunately, they have not maintained the system - and we need more good Git exercises.

The exercises are designed for use when we are teaching Git courses. You should be able to use them as self-contained exercises that will allow you to keep your Git skills sharp.
